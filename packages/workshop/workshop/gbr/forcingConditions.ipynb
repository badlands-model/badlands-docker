The dataset was resampled to a resolution of 2 km. To construct the paleo-surface we further modified the bathymetry to account for (1) sediment accumulation along the coast and the inner shelf and (2) coral reef development since the Holocene.\n",

    "To construct our initial paleo-surface to run the model, we assumed an average maximum 7.5 m deposition along the entire coast at around the 15 m isobath, tapering to 0 m at the coast and at the 25 m isobath, and removed this estimated sediment wedge from the initial surface. \n",

Details of reef cores reaching the Pleistocene surface in the GBR show variations in reef thicknesses from 5 to 25 m. To remove the Holocene coral reefs, we first obtained the modern reef positions and remove estimated Holocene coral reef thicknesses in these locations."
