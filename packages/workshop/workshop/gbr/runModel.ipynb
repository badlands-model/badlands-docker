    "At basin-scale sediment transport and reef evolution are strongly controlled by large-scale forcings. Our model allows consideration of the following set of external forcing mechanisms: \n",
    "+ sea-level oscillations, \n",
    "+ rates of tectonic changes, \n",
    "+ rainfall regimes and \n",
    "+ boundary wave conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial and temporal variations in precipitation can be applied as a set of maps representing an annual rainfall regime. The tectonic changes are provided as a series of temporal maps. Each map can have variable spatial cumulative displacements making it possible to simulate complex 3D tectonic evolution with both vertical (uplift and subsidence) and horizontal directions. The combination of these forcing mechanisms controls the evolution of the hydrodynamic conditions and the associated sediment transport regimes as well as marine carbonate production.\n",
