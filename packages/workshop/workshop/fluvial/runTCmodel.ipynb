    "Our second simulation uses the Tool & cover approach, which is one of the **transport-limited models** available in Badlands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, volumetric sediment transport capacity ($Q_t$) is defined using a power law function of unit stream power:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_t=\\kappa_{t} (PA)^{m_t} S^{n_t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\kappa_{t}$ is a dimensional coefficient describing the transportability of channel sediment and $m_t$ and $n_t$ are dimensionless positive constants. In equation above, the threshold of motion (the critical shear stress) is assumed to be negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional term is now introduced in the stream power model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\epsilon}=\\kappa_{tc} f(Q_s) (PA)^m S^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $f(Q_{s})$ representing a variety of plausible models for the dependence of river incision rate on sediment flux. In the standard detachment-limited, $f(Q_{s})$ is equal to unity, which corresponds to cases where $Q_{s} \\ll Q_{t}$. Where sediment flux equals or exceeds transport capacity ($Q_s/Q_t \\ge 1$) the system is by definition transport-limited (and  depositional if $Q_s/Q_t > 1$).\n",

    "Both qualitative and experimental observations have shown that sediment flux has a dual role in the erosion process. First, when sediment flux is low relative to capacity, erosion potential increases with sediment flux (_tool effect_: bedrock abrasion and plucking). Then, with increased sediment flux, erosion is inhibited (_cover effect_: sediments protect the bed from impacts by saltating particles). Following Gasparini et al. (2007), we adopt a parabolic form that reaches a maximum at $Q_s/Q_t = 1/2$ (Sklar et al., 2006):\n",
