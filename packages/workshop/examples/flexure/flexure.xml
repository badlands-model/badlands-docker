         The stream power law is a simplified form of the usual expression of
         sediment transport by water flow, in which the transport rate is assumed
         to be equal to the local carrying capacity, which is itself a function of
         boundary shear stress. -->

             and sediment transport capacity.
             Generally, m and n are both positive, and their ratio
             (m/n) is considered to be close to 0.5 -->
