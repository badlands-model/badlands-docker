    "# Stratigraphic evolution of a passive continental margin influenced by dynamic topography \n",

    "In this example, we investigate the stratigraphic evolution of a passive continental margin under _sea-level fluctuations_, _thermal subsidence_ and _dynamic topography_ (transient uplift and subsidence). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Dynamic topography is the surface expression of the deep Earth mantle convection, and could be recorded in sedimentary layers when it interacts with surface processes. However, its low amplitude and long wavelength make it diffucult to be extracted from geological recordes. Our goal here is to set up a work-flow of building a forward stratigraphic modelling framework, to quantify the influence of dynamic topography on the development of stratal architecture at a passive continental margin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial surface is 300 km by 200 km with the space resolution of 1.0 km (a higher resolution could be 0.5 km). It includes a flat plateau, a gently-sloping continental plain and a continental margin consisting of a continetal shelf, a slope and a basin floor.  \n",
