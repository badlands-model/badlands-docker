    Note:
        The method is relatively fast compared to other techniques

    The purpose of this function is **twofold**.

    First, it efficiently decomposes the domain based on the number of processors available.
    Second, it returns to all processors the partition IDs for each nodes composing the TIN.

        Xdecomp: integers that specifies the number of processors along X axis (default: 1).
        Ydecomp: integers that specifies the number of processors along Y axis (default: 1).
